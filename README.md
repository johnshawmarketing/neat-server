# Neighborhood Environment Assessment Tool (NEAT)

## About N.E.A.T
### The App
Neat serves to help local researchers, officials and community stakeholders dynamically map environmental concerns in the various neighborhoods of their city. These might include poor street lighting, potholes, derelict buildings, etc. Researchers can survey neighborhoods and map these issues in real time. They are even able to indicate severity.

This data can then be used in city planning, budget decisions, crime interventions, etc. to set realistic targets and solutions. The visual interface makes it very easy for people to understand and communicate.
